Snake Game:
This is a project that uses Python and Pygame to create a classic snake game. Pygame is a powerful and flexible library that provides access to graphics, sound, input, and other features that are essential for game development. In this project, I will show you how to use Pygame to create a simple snake game with a snake, food, and score.
I made this project for clearing my concepts reagarding functions and develop simple logic. This was a fun project to do as....you know....who doesn't like games :) . Enjoy!!
